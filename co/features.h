/**
* @namespace co
* @brief Object-oriented network library.
*
* Collage is a cross-platform C++ library for building heterogenous,
* distributed applications. Among other things, it is the cluster backend for
* the Equalizer parallel rendering framework. Collage provides an abstraction
* of different network connections, peer-to-peer messaging, node discovery,
* synchronization and high-performance, object-oriented, versioned data
* distribution. Collage is designed for low-overhead multi-threaded execution
* which allows applications to easily exploit multi-core architectures.
*
* On the lowest layer, Collage provides the Connection, which implements a
* stream-oriented communication primitive between endpoints. Various protocols
* are implemented, and can be created using Connection::create with a
* ConnectionDescription using the corresponding ConnectionType and related
* parameters. A ConnectionSet may be used to demultiplex input from a set of
* connections.
*
* The next abstraction in Collage offers peer-to-peer communication between
* processes, represented by Node and LocalNode. A process typically uses one
* LocalNode to listen on connection requests and to communicate with other
* nodes. A Node is a proxy for a remote LocalNode. To exchange information, an
* OCommand is send using the node proxy. The remote local node receives it as
* an ICommand and dispatches it to a CommandQueue. The queue is processed by
* another thread, which invokes a CommandFunc. The queue and handler method are
* pre-registered with the proper Dispatcher. The command specializations
* ObjectOCommand and ObjectICommand dispatch the command to a registered
* Object.
*
* The Object facilitates the data distribution for C++ classes. An object is
* registered with a listening LocalNode, which allows the mapping of this
* object to other instances, on the same node or other nodes. Objects can be
* static or versioned. Versioned objects can commit new versions, sync
* committed versions and can send object commands to other instances.
*
* The following Figure depicts the UML class diagram of the major Collage
* classes:
