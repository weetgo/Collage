/**
 * A zeroconf communicator.

 * When Collage is compiled with Servus support (COLLAGE_USE_SERVUS), it uses
 * the ZeroConf service "_collage._tcp" to announce the presence of a listening
 * LocalNode using the zeroconf protocol, unless the LocalNode has no listening
 * connections. This class may be used to add additional key/value pairs to this
 * service to announce application-specific data, and to retrieve a snapshot of
 * all key/value pairs of all discovered nodes on the network. Internal keys
 * start with 'co_', this prefix should not be used by applications. Please
 * refer to the documentation of servus::Servus::set() for details.
 *
 * When Collage is compiled without Servus support, this class implements
 * dummy functionality.
