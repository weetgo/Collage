/**
 * An interface definition for communication between hosts.
 *
 * Connections are stream-oriented communication lines. The parameters of a
 * Connection are described in a ConnectionDescription, which is used in
 * create(), listen() and connect(). A Connection has a Connection::State, which
 * changes when calling listen(), connect() or close(), or whenever the
 * underlying connection is closed by the operating system.
 *
 * The Connection class defines the interface for connections, various derived
 * classes implement it for the low-level communication protocols, e.g.,
 * SocketConnection for TCP/IP or RSPConnection for UDP-based reliable
 * multicast. An implementation may not implement all the functionality defined
 * in this interface.
 *
 * The Connection is used reference-counted throughout the Collage API.
